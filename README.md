bsos
===

Experimental \*nix-like OS.

## Building
As of right now, bsos is incredibly simple and only builds on Linux AMD64 platforms.
However, once built, the "os-image" file (included in the repo), can be run on any x86 system.

To build, make sure that you have gcc and nasm installed:
```
git clone https://github.com/aplabs/bsos.git
cd bsos
make
```
